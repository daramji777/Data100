# Informal Response 5

  Advancements in how to collect and analyze data has always led to revolutions in sciences. For example, with the development of the microscope, biologists are able to study organisms at a more fundamental level of cells while with the development of mass spectrometry, chemists are able to identify and study the structure and properties of chemicals they created to perhaps find a suitable daily use for the compound. Similarly, we are revolutionaizing data science by being able to collect massive amounts of data from our smartphone usages and developing supercomputers to handle complex computations for analyzing the increasingly complex data set we obtain. As a result, we gained the ability to more accurately describe human development processes and apply these predicting techniques in more areas of human development. Although there are some concerns about misuse of the power of data science and there are certainly obstacles for data scientsits to overcome, data science can definitely be used to improve the human condition. 
  We witnessed significant gains in analyzing living conditions for providing aid to developing and struggling areas, with the help of big data collected from phone use data, which helps us describe and predict human development processes. I anticipate data science will be used in genome sequencing to unveil the fundamental reason for individual differences in humans and perhaps predicting global environmental changes to help predict our responses as a community against natural disasters. However, as the use of data science to make important decisions is increasing, we need to be wary that algorithms alone is not sufficient to make the most optimal decisions for humans, so data scientists should collaborate with experts of the field to make the best judgment. There are also still major obstacles that exist before data science can contribute towards improving the total freedoms. For example, since many of the algorithms are kept in secret, some might take advantage of this to make personal gains rather than making the optimal choice for the community. This might cast doubts in some people's minds in relying on data science to make judgments for humans. Therefore, we also need to make them more transparent so that we can hold them accountable for the decisions they make. If such improvements are made, data science can serve to improve the human condition by analyzing the best living conditions for humans based on predictions of the future environment that we must adapt to for survival.
