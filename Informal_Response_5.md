Advancements in how to collect and analyze data has always led to revolutions in sciences. For example, with the development of the microscope, biologists are able to study organisms at a more fundamental level of cells while with the development of mass spectrometry, chemists are able to identify and study the structure and properties of chemicals they created to perhaps find a suitable daily use for the compound. Similarly, we are revolutionaizing data science by being able to collect massive amounts of data from our smartphone usages and developing supercomputers to handle complex computations for analyzing the increasingly complex data set we obtain. As a result, we gained the ability to more accurately describe human development processes and apply these predicting techniques in more areas of human development. Although there are some concerns about misuse of the power of data science and there are certainly obstacles for data scientsits to overcome, data science can definitely be used to improve the human condition.
