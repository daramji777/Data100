Advancements in how to collect and analyze data has always led to revolutions in sciences. For example, with the development of the microscope, biologists are able to study organisms at a more fundamental level of cells while with the development of mass spectrometry, chemists are able to identify and study the structure and properties of chemicals they created to perhaps find a suitable daily use for the compound. Similarly, we are revolutionaizing data science by being able to collect massive amounts of data from our smartphone usages and developing supercomputers to handle complex computations for analyzing the increasingly complex data set we obtain. As a result, we gained the ability to more accurately describe human development processes and apply these predicting techniques in more areas of human development. Although there are some concerns about misuse of the power of data science and there are certainly obstacles for data scientsits to overcome, data science can definitely be used to improve the human condition. 





Where  have  we  witnessed  significant  gains  in  our  ability  to  describe,  analyze  and  predict human development processes?   Where do you anticipate hope for using data science as the  means  to  elevate  our  understanding  of  individual  and  community  scale  behavior?  Where do you identify or anticipate reasons to be concerned about the use of data science in a manner that could serve to harm?   What are some of the major obstacles that exist in order  for  data  science  to  contribute  towards  reducing  unfreedoms  and  improving  upon  the sum  total  of  freedoms  we  experience  as  humanity?    What  is  your  prediction  for  how  data science can serve to improve the human condition?
