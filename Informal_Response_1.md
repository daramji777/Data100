# Informal Response 1 

  As the world is becoming more connected through the widespread availability of cell phones, more personal data than ever are being collected from around the globe. While the plethora of data could be used to quickly assess and solve problems such as poverty and repairing damage caused by natural disasters. However, with the current analysis tools, using such widely available data to determine who needs help can be biased and inaccurate. When solving these problems relate directly to people’s livelihood, are “good intentions” of companies enough to excuse their shortcomings in the past?

  Theoretically, using data collected from phone use would allow aid to be distributed to people in more immediate need in a timelier fashion (Blumenstock, 2018). It also provides companies a method that is cheaper than surveys and interviews in collecting and producing maps for this purpose (Blumenstock 2018). However, instances in the past has shown that algorithms tend to favor those in a better living condition and the inferences made from the data quickly becomes outdated, even within the year due to changing patterns in communication throughout the year (Blumenstock, 2018). This means that although companies have attempted with good intents on distributing aid to those in need, they have ultimately failed in correctly identifying and delivering adequate aid to those people. 

  These shortcomings are partly due to the lack of transparency in how the data is collected and analyzed and also balancing between giving out aid and maximizing profit for the company. However, there are also steps such as validating the maps they create and allowing collaboration between the data scientists and humanity researchers to better their algorithms (Blumenstock, 2018). I think that if a company is going to commit to giving out aid effectively using the phone use data, they would have to step up their precision in data analysis and take account of the local situation to make a more accurate assessment of who needs the most aid because this is a matter concerning millions of lives.
