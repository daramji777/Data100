1. Owen Barder's definition of development is a property of economic and social system, which is an extension to the definition by Amartya Sen, who said that development is improving the quality of life and giving people a wider range of choices about their future. Barder's definition of development is an improvement over Sen's definition because while Sen's definition focuses on development as a sum of positive changes in a community, Barder's definition better encompasses the fact that development has multiple facets that we should consider and we should be concerned with the distribution of development, not simply the total sum. 

2. The toaster project was a project that a student undertook to create the cheapest commercial toaster from scratch. Thomas Thwaites tried to obtain all the materials, manufacture the components, and assemble a toaster all by himself. Although he proclaimed his final product a success, in terms of making a functional toaster, he has failed. The significance of this example in the context of complexity is that even something that looks deceptively simple as making a $6 toaster from scratch has multiple aspects that one has to consider in order to make it work, and neglecting even one aspect of it could make the final product a disaster. 

3. According to Barder, we have not been successful in developing economic models that can accurately describe and predict economic growth because no one can agree on what aspect of society they should focus on in developing a model, such as capital and technology. For the models that somewhat accurately describes the economic growth, they attribute the growth to a mysterious component that turns out to be a major consideration in the model.

4. Steve Jones is an evolutionary biologist who developed a new design for a nozzle for making soap crystals at uni-lever. He was extremely successful in this project as he as able to create a nozzle that was at least 100% more efficient than the original nozzle.

5. A complex adaptive system is interactions between many adaptive agents which are all coevolving. Some of the important features of complex adaptive systems is that it is a complex non-linear system, it is impossible to predict details but rather the bigger pictures, the patterns of the system is not linked to a specific part of the system, the system tends to be more complex, and they do not tend towards equilibrium.
