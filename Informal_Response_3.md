# Informal Response 3

1. Owen Barder's definition of development is a property of economic and social system, which is an extension to the definition by Amartya Sen, who said that development is improving the quality of life and giving people a wider range of choices about their future. Barder's definition of development is an improvement over Sen's definition because while Sen's definition focuses on development as a sum of positive changes in a community, Barder's definition better encompasses the fact that development has multiple facets that we should consider and we should be concerned with the distribution of development, not simply the total sum. 

2. The toaster project was a project that a student undertook to create the cheapest commercial toaster from scratch. Thomas Thwaites tried to obtain all the materials, manufacture the components, and assemble a toaster all by himself. Although he proclaimed his final product a success, in terms of making a functional toaster, he has failed. The significance of this example in the context of complexity is that even something that looks deceptively simple as making a $6 toaster from scratch has multiple aspects that one has to consider in order to make it work, and neglecting even one aspect of it could make the final product a disaster. 

3. According to Barder, we have not been successful in developing economic models that can accurately describe and predict economic growth because no one can agree on what aspect of society they should focus on in developing a model, such as capital and technology. For the models that somewhat accurately describes the economic growth, they attribute the growth to a mysterious component that turns out to be a major consideration in the model.

4. Steve Jones is an evolutionary biologist who developed a new design for a nozzle for making soap crystals at uni-lever. He was extremely successful in this project as he as able to create a nozzle that was at least 100% more efficient than the original nozzle.

5. A complex adaptive system is interactions between many adaptive agents which are all coevolving. Some of the important features of complex adaptive systems is that it is a complex non-linear system, it is impossible to predict details but rather the bigger pictures, the patterns of the system is not linked to a specific part of the system, the system tends to be more complex, and they do not tend towards equilibrium. 

6. Haile Selassie was the last emperor of Ethiopia, to whom all reports about the country's economy was made and he made all the economic decisions himself. He refused to listen about poverty in the nation, and as a result, suppressed any possibility of Ethiopia as a whole growing economically. This was because although the elites wanted to accumulate wealth, they did not want their status as elites be threatened. 

7. Barder recommends resisting engineering as a policy implication because he says that developing solutions in a complex adaptive system is very challenging. Shown in the soap crystal nozzle development, improvements made by evolutionary processes often is superior to designed improvement. In addition, since the system is nonlinear, it is impossible to predict change in the system. Barder also says that we should avoid isomorphic mimicry, in which we establish institutions that do not fit with the environment nor do they evolve with the environment, rendering them useless although they appear to be the solution to the problem.

8. Barder says that we can resist fatalism by not simply accepting the biological process of natural selection, but we can accelerate and shape the process of evolution. Norman Borlaug was the person who brought about the green revolution by developing  high-yield disease resistant wheats through selective breeding of wheats, leading to a great increase in crops.
