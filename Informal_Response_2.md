As we accumulate petabytes of data during the course of this digital age, we found new ways to analyze the massive amounts of Big Data with supercomputers (Anderson, 2008). Compared to the old methods of analyzing data, the data set that the digital age brings us is much more massive in size and delves into specific details than previous data sets (Kitchin, 2014). As a result, we can no longer rely on the old scientific way of analyzing data and establishing causation, but we have to use mathematical algorithms to establish correlation and then give real life context (Anderson, 2008). We no longer have to know why something happens, but rather just know that they do happen (Anderson, 2008). Since such analyses yield highly successful conclusions, we see an increased use of data science in various areas of study such as the sciences and even social sciences, making data science an interdisciplinary study.
