As we accumulate petabytes of data during the course of this digital age, we found new ways to analyze the massive amounts of Big Data with supercomputers (Anderson, 2008). Compared to the old methods of analyzing data, the data set that the digital age brings us is much more massive in size and delves into specific details than previous data sets (Kitchin, 2014). As a result, we can no longer rely on the old scientific way of analyzing data and establishing causation, but we have to use mathematical algorithms to establish correlation and then give real life context (Anderson, 2008). We no longer have to know why something happens, but rather just know that they do happen (Anderson, 2008). Since such analyses yield highly successful conclusions, we see an increased use of data science in various areas of study such as the sciences and even social sciences, making data science an interdisciplinary study. 

Data deluge is advancing a better understanding of human movement because compared to the models made through the scientific methods of hypotheses, experiments, and modeling, they give a more accurate reading of the data set (Anderson, 2008). As a result, data science contributes to our improved understanding of human development as a complex system because it allows us to work with more refined data sets that has the potential to capture subtle correlations between interactions and more accurately predict behaviors (Anderson, 2008). 

However, there are caveats in the current method of using Big Data analysis that should be addressed to make data science a more reliable method of analyzing data. First, we have to be aware that the current methods of data collection and analysis algorithms are designed to obtain a certain data set and conduct searches for previously known patterns (Kitchin, 2014). This has the potential to yield biased conclusions that might prevent us from recognizing the big picture (Kitchin, 2014). Secondly, interpretation of the data should be done in conjunction with those who are familiar with the culture that is being analyzed so that we are able to get a more accurate picture from the data (Kitchin, 2014).
