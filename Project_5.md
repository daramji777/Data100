The total population in Tartu County, Estonia is estimated to be 152002 people, and there are 23 distinctly defined urban areas. We can see that among the urban areas, the population size and densities are all similar and most areas are either around the geographical center of Tartu County or along the eastern border of the county. We can also see a major highway connecting the largest urban area to a neighboring county as well as smaller roads connecting all the smaller urban areas. However, we see that in areas with no distinct urban areas, we see no major roads. Finally, we also observe many health care facilities, especially pharmacies, are clustered within the largest urban area.
