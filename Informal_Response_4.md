# Informal Response 4

One example that Geoff West provides as how scales can be used to understand human development as a complex and adapting social economic system is the superlinear scaling seen in cities. He says that although different cities are not exact copies of each other and their components such as the people living there might be completely variable from city to city, when the size of a city doubles, its products increase by 1.15 times. However, the required number of services that the city needs to function such as gas stations follow a sublinear scaling, increasing only by 0.85 times. This is similar to another example that West provides to show that human development is a complex system. Geoff West gives companies as another example of sublinear scaling, citing that when a company doubles in size, the amount of resources they need to function is about 0.9 times more than the original size. This is interesting because companies show similar scaling tendencies as organisms, where their metabolism rates only need to increase by 0.85 times when they double in body size. As companies parallel organisms because they also tend to disappear relatively easily over time (compared to cities), the similar sublinear tendencies they exhibit suggest that there is some natural law behind this phenomena. Another example he gives is how our social network is divided into multiple layers. He explains that moving from one layer to the next triples the number of people we have connections with, but the degree of intimacy also decreases. This consistent factor of scaling is also shown in city development, and resembles a fractal.

Geoff West says that although scientists welcome big data because it helps them make better predictions and reliable theories, we should not be blindly trusting conclusions from big data analysis because correlation does not mean causation. Hence, he thinks that it is crucial for theory to accompany big data analysis to get a full picture of why a phenomena is happening in our society. For example, although the number of suicides increased in the same fashion as spendings on science and technology in the first decade of this century, we cannot conclude that the increase in suicide is directly caused by spendings on science. Developing a theory here would help in explaining such phenomena.
